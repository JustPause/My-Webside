            <p>As a 3D hobbyist artist, I have a strong understanding of 3D meshes, textures, smooth motion, and procedural generation, which greatly helps me in programming. I also have an artist's eye for color combinations, shadows, and composition in the scene.</p>

            <p>I've turned my old PC at home into a hub for running game servers and websites. I've organized everything neatly using special containers called Docker and Podman, which help keep things running smoothly.</p>
